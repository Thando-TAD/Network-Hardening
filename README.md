# Network-Hardening
It the process of securing a computer network by lowering its vuinerabilities is known as network hardening.
Its includes defending servers, apps, and cloud resources against intrusions and incorrect setups.
# Tools and Technologies
- Amazon Inspector : Automated vulnerability scanning.
- AWS Lambda : Scanned functions for package-level vulnerabilities.
- Security Groups and NACLs : Controlled inbound and outbound traffics.
- IAM Roles and Policies : Enforces least privilege access.
- CloudWatch & GuardDuty : monitores security metrics and threats.

# What I Did

- enabled Lambda function vulnerability scanning in Python 3.9 environments using Amazon Inspector

- reviewed remediation-related CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) findings

- Security Group rules and network ACLs were used to limit needless access.

- Multi-layered security controls were put in place for both public and private subnets.

- used monitoring and logging to find questionable activity.
