# Network-Hardening
It the process of securing a computer network by lowering its vuinerabilities is known as network hardening.
Its includes defending servers, apps, and cloud resources against intrusions and incorrect setups.
# Tools and Technologies
- Amazon Inspector : Automated vulnerability scanning.
- AWS Lambda : Scanned functions for package-level vulnerabilities.
- Security Groups and NACLs : Controlled inbound and outbound traffics.
- IAM Roles and Policies : Enforces least privilege access.
- CloudWatch & GuardDuty : monitores security metrics and threats.

# What I Did

- enabled Lambda function vulnerability to scan in Python environments using Amazon Inspector.

- Used security group rules and network ACLs were used to limit needless access.

- Implement Multi-layered security controls for both public and private subnets.

- use monitoring and logging to find suspicious activities.

# Key Skills
 - Cloud Security
 - AWS secuirty services
 - Network Architecture
 - Vulnerabilities Management

# What I learned 
Network Hardening is appealing because it's hands on and technical, you fet to secire real cloud systems. It's impactful because you will be protecting business and users from threats.
It's build skills for high demand roles like Cloud Security Engineer, DevSecOps Specialist etc.
